= Forter

  Forte is an esoteric programming language created by ais523 in 2006, based
  around redefinition of constants. Its syntax is similar to BASIC (a
  non-esoteric language). It is called Forte due to the mess it makes of the
  Peano postulates.
  
1. Read http://esolangs.org/wiki/Forte
2. Read that again, since you probably don't understand it yet (I didn't)
3. Run bin/forter myscript.fo
